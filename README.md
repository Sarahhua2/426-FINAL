# Web-Development Final Project: Task Management Website

## Overview

For our final project, we developed a task management website. It features a comprehensive system that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The platform supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for task management. Additionally, it integrates a third-party API to fetch and display inspirational quotes, which users can also delete if desired.

## Features

Task Management: Users can create, view, modify, and delete tasks.
Inspirational Quotes: Fetch quotes from a third-party API to inspire users during their task management.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface that makes managing tasks and viewing quotes easy.

## Front-End 

Our front end is interactive and event-driven. Users can click on a button to create, modify, and delete their tasks 

## Backend 

Our backend serves two resources (tasks and quotes) with a RESTful CRUD API

## Third-Party API 

Our website integrates a quotes API (https://type.fit/api/quotes), that gives users a quote upon pressing the button.


## Session Persistence

A user's data is stored using session storage. Data persists throughout the pages in a single session.
